My journey into product design started with discovering the human-centred approach for running a personal training business. 

For over eight years, I have developed a strong interest in behavioural psychology and always intrigued to learn more about people. And this allowed me to excel in balancing customer and business needs.

I’m now looking for an opportunity to join a company with a collaborative design team, and establish myself as a full time designer. 

With my desire to take initiatives and learn on the go, I am eager to get my hands dirty in the whole design process and flourish in this exciting path. 

###### **My north star:**

I want to pursue design to create a positive impact for people and change things for the better. 

###### **In my free time:**

I enjoy practising Brazilian Ju-Jitsu, bouldering, callisthenics training, travelling to explore new cultures and taste all the food!
